        Coding Challenge #1
        <!-- Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), 
            which is calculated using 
            the formula: BMI = mass / height ** 2 = mass / (height * height) 
            (mass in kg and height in meter). 
            Your tasks: 
            1. Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables 
            2. Calculate both their BMIs using the formula (you can even implement both versions) 
            3. Create a Boolean variable 'markHigherBMI' containing information about whether Mark has a higher BMI than John. 
            Test data: 
            ยง Data 1: Marks weights 78 kg and is 1.69 m tall. John weights 92 kg and is 1.95 m tall. 
            ยง Data 2: Marks weights 95 kg and is 1.88 m tall. John weights 85 kg and is 1.76 m tall -->
