            <!-- Coding Challenge #2 -->
            <!-- Use the BMI example from Challenge #1, and the code you already wrote, and improve it. -->
            <!-- Your tasks: 1. Print a nice output to the console, saying who has the higher BMI. 
                The message is either "Mark's BMI is higher than John's!" or "John's BMI is higher than Mark's!"
            2. Use a template literal to include the BMI values in the outputs. 
            Example: "Mark's BMI (28.3) is higher than John's (23.9)!"
             Hint: Use an if/else statement. -->
