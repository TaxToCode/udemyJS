                        LECTURE: Function Declarations vs. Expressions
            1. The world population is 7900 million people. Create a function declaration
            called 'percentageOfWorld1' which receives a 'population' value, and
            returns the percentage of the world population that the given population
            represents. 
            For example, China has 1441 million people, so it's about 18.2% of
            the world population

            2. To calculate the percentage, divide the given 'population' value by 7900
            and then multiply by 100
            
            3. Call 'percentageOfWorld1' for 3 populations of countries of your choice,
            store the results into variables, and log them to the console
            
            4. Create a function expression which does the exact same thing, called
            'percentageOfWorld2', and also call it with 3 country populations (can be
            the same populations)

            function percentageOfWorld1(population){
               return `${(population/7900)*100}%` 
               
            }
            const percentageOfWorld2 = function(population){
                return `${(population/7900)*100}%` 
            } 
            const countryA = percentageOfWorld1(100);
            const countryB = percentageOfWorld1(1400);
            const countryC = percentageOfWorld1(7600);

            console.log(countryA,countryB,countryC);
